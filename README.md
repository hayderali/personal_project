#This is my Paint Project
​
## This program has been written with the ruby gem known as green_shoes that allows you to create GUI. With the usage of a GUI I have created an interactive paint programme.
​
### How to run
​
- Navigate to the directory via a terminal
- Once inside the directory, type in "bundler install".
- Now type "ruby paint.rb" to load the file
​
### How to use
​
- If you click and drag the mouse around on the left screen it will paint.
- You can increase and decrease the brush size but clicking the buttons. You can also clean the page.
- If you click on any of the rectangles on the left you can change the colour of the paint brush.
​
### The right screen is a duplicate screen that mimics the left to see if you have a particular type of colour blindness.
 
- However that functionality is not fully implemented due to technical issues with green_shoes.
